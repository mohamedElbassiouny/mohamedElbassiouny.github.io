Designed a virtual reality app its main idea is a 5 chambers gallery every chamber specialized at an Egyptian era ( Pharaonic, Greek, Christian, Islamic, revolution ) every era is archived with photos which is main idea of app is watching it the app built by Unity and C# scripts and Google VR SDK .

```yaml
image:
  background: filename.png
```

This little bit of YAML makes the assumption that your background image asset is in the `/images` folder. If you place it somewhere else or are hotlinking from the web, just include the full http(s):// URL. Either way you should have a background image that is tiled.

If you want to set a background image for the entire site just add `background: filename.png` to your `_config.yml` and BOOM --- background images on every page!
